<h1> SNAKE GAME </h1>

<h2> My first game with Java </h2>

<h5> In order to use Applets, I needed to change into JDK 8. Applets are no longer availables in JDK 11</h5>

<h6>Version 1.0</h6>
<p>I created this little Java game using Applet for the first time. Finally, the snake is moving through the screen!</p>


<h6>Version 1.1</h6>
<p>Now, when you it a wall or you hit yoursellf, the game is over.</p>

<h6>Version 1.2</h6>
<p>I added a random token on the screen. Once you catch it, the snake will be longer!</p>

<h6>Version 2.0</h6>
<p>Last update. Once the snake "dies" it will appear "Game Over" and your Score (number of tokens collected).</p>
